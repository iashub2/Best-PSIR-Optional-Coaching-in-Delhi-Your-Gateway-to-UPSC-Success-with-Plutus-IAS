## Why PSIR Stands Out as a UPSC Optional Subject

- **Scoring Powerhouse**: Recent trends show 280+ marks possible with structured answers blending theory and current events. Toppers like Ishita Kishore (AIR 1, 2022) aced it.
- **Skill Booster**: Hones critical thinking, articulation, and ethics—gold for interviews. It's ideal for humanities grads or those fascinated by Nehru's Panchsheel.
- **Career Edge**: Preps you for diplomatic roles, think tanks, or UN gigs post-UPSC.

## Unpacking the UPSC PSIR Optional Syllabus

Spanning 500 marks across two papers, PSIR demands a balance of Western thinkers and Indian realities. Always verify the latest UPSC notification for nuances.

### Paper I: Political Theory and Indian Politics
This paper lays the ideological foundation, testing conceptual clarity and application.

- **Political Theory**: Western classics—Plato's Republic, Machiavelli's Prince, Marx's dialectics, Rawls' justice. Indian angles like Gandhi's swaraj or Ambedkar's social justice.
- **Indian Political Thought**: From Kautilya's Arthashastra to moderns like Savarkar—focus on nationalism and secularism.
- **Indian Government and Politics**: Constitution's evolution (salient features, amendments), federalism (centre-state tensions), judiciary (PILs, collegium), and parties (BJP's rise, coalition dynamics).
- **Key Institutions**: Parliament, executive, election reforms—link to Article 370 abrogation.

Emphasise diagrams for structures like parliamentary committees.

### Paper II: Comparative Politics and International Relations
Here, global lenses meet Indian diplomacy—current-heavy for dynamic answers.

- **Comparative Political Analysis**: Approaches (systems theory), state-society relations, globalisation's impact.
- **Politics of Representation and Participation**: Gender quotas, civil society (NGOs like Amnesty), and democratisation in Asia-Africa.
- **Globalisation**: Neo-liberalism, WTO, climate pacts—India's stance in G20.
- **International Relations**: Theories (realism vs. liberalism), key events (Cold War, UN reforms), India's foreign policy (non-alignment to Act East), bilateral ties (Indo-US nuclear deal), and regional bodies (SAARC, BIMSTEC).

PYQs from 2018-2024 reveal twists—practice linking IR to current crises like Ukraine war. Dive deeper with [best PSIR optional test series](https://plutusias.com/political-science-international-relation/test-series).
